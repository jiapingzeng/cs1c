-0 Consider returning the empty set (instead of null) when all elements
   are > target.
   
   
+0.5 Excellent documentation of your source code.


+0.5 Excellent description of the purpose of each test case in your RUN and README file.


Extra Credit Opportunity:
+2 implementation of findSubset() for SongEntry type.

+2 clearly defined test cases for findSubset() method.   

-Bita.
